. Click the `activate_satellite` job template.


== Use Ansible Tower and Satellite 6 Integration During Provisioning

It is a relatively common requirement to register newly provisioned Linux VMs directly with Red Hat Satellite 6 (or Foreman) as part of the provisioning process. This ensures that the resultant VM is patched and up-to-date and configured by Puppet according to a server role.

Registering a new system with Satellite 6 currently requires two operations. You must create a Satellite _host_ entry, which registers the server as a configuration management client, manageable by Puppet. You also must use `subscription-manager` to activate the server as a _content host_, which associates one or more Red Hat subscriptions with the server, and makes software package repository content available.

In this exercise, you look at the changes to your provisioning workflow that are needed to make this happen.

=== Explore Triggering Client Operations

In this section, you clone a VM from a fully installed _fat_ template. Fat templates are those for which no kickstarting is performed. Cloning from template (infrastructure providers) or image (cloud providers) presents you with the challenge of how to initiate several commands on the new VM, including `subscription-manager register`, using dynamic arguments such as `--activationkey` or `--org`.

There are several ways of remotely running commands in a newly created VM:

* VMware VIX SDK Library, to connect to VMware Tools running in a guest (VMware only)
* `cloud-init` (Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization, OpenStack, and Amazon providers)
* SSH, including Ansible (all providers)

In this lab, you trigger the subscription-manager registration of the newly provisioned system using an Ansible playbook via Ansible Tower.

A host entry in Satellite 6 requires certain parameters:

* Host name
* Host's MAC address
* Location
* Organization
* Puppet environment
* Architecture
* Operating system
* Media
* Partition table
* Domain
* Root password

You can define a host group in Satellite, containing defaults for several of these parameters. When you create the host entry, you can specify a host group as a configuration template.

=== Confirm Satellite Environment Configuration

In this section, you confirm the Satellite environment configuration. To keep the example simple, you allow for provisioning Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 and 7 servers (both 64-bit), but you create a single generic host group and activation key for each operating system version.

==== Confirm Activation Keys in Satellite 6

When a newly provisioned system registers with Satellite as a content host, it can include an activation key name as an argument to `subscription-manager`.

. Log in to your Satellite 6 server at `https://sat-$GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com` with user `admin` and password `r3dh4t1!`.
. In *Content -> Activation keys*, confirm that there is an existing activation key called `rhel7`:
+
image::images/satscreenshot6.png[]

* These activation keys define defaults for:

** Content view and life-cycle environment ("Production")
** Red Hat subscriptions
** Repository content sets

* Ansible subscribes the VM to Satellite using this `rhel7` key.

==== Confirm Host Groups in Satellite 6

. In your Satellite 6 server, go to *Configure -> Host Groups* and confirm that there is a host group named `Generic_RHEL7_Servers`:
+
image::images/satscreenshot1.png[]

* Host groups define defaults for:

** Puppet environment
** Architecture
** Operating system
** Media
** Partition table
** Domain
** Root password

=== Confirm Satellite Services

Sometimes the Satellite server does not start up correctly in the lab environment.

. From `workstation`, use SSH as `root` to access `sat.example.com`.
. Run the following command to check the services status:
+
[source,text]
----
[root@sat ~]# katello-service status
----

.. Look for failures on the last line of the output:
+
[source,text]
----
Some services failed to status: mongod,pulp_celerybeat
----

.. If you see this failure, do this:
+
[source,text]
----
[root@sat ~]# katello-service restart
----

.. If you had to restart the services, run the status again:
+
[source,text]
----
[root@sat ~]# katello-service status
----

.. Look for success on the last line of the output:
+
[source,text]
----
Success!
----

=== Modify CloudForms Provisioning Workflow

From the CloudForms UI, make two additions to the `VMProvision_VM` state machine. You add a `RegisterSatellite` state to register the new VM with Satellite 6 as a host. You create code that integrates with the Satellite API to add the VM to a host group.

You also add an `ActivateSatellite` state to launch an Ansible playbook via Ansible Tower and an SSH that initiates the `subscription-manager` activation of the new system as a content host.

Both of these stages must be added at some point after the VM is provisioned.

. Log in as the admin user with password r3dh4t1! to CloudForms at https://cf-$GUID.rhpds.opentlc.com.
+
[NOTE]
Replace `$GUID` with the GUID provided to you in the provisioning email you received from the OPENTLC lab system.

. Navigate to *Automation -> Automate -> Explorer*

. Ensure only `ManageIQ`, `RedHat`, and `SatDomain` Automate domains are enabled, and that `SatDomain` is at the top of the tree.  Any other custom domains should be disabled.

. Copy the `/ManageIQ/Infrastructure/VM/Provisioning/StateMachines/VMProvision_VM/Provision VM from Template (template)` instance to `SatDomain`.

. Edit the class schema at `/SatDomain/Infrastructure/VM/Provisioning/StateMachines/VMProvision_VM` to add these states:
* `RegisterSatellite`
* `ActivateSatellite`
+
image::images/satelliteedits.png[]
+
. Modify the sequence so that it looks like this:
+
image::images/schema_order.png[]

. Edit the `/SatDomain/Infrastructure/VM/Provisioning/StateMachines/VMProvision_VM/Provision VM from Template (template)` instance:
.. Populate `RegisterSatellite` with `/Integration/Satellite/Methods/RegisterSatellite`.
.. Populate `ActivateSatellite` with `/AutomationManagement/AnsibleTower/Operations/JobTemplate/activate_satellite`.
+
[NOTE]
This uses the built-in functionality in Automate to launch an Ansible playbook via Ansible Tower for the VM being built. The `activate_satellite` string corresponds to a job template predefined in your Ansible Tower. You could put any job template defined in Ansible Tower that you wish in here assuming it works with the host being built. You can see a list of job templates that CloudForms is aware of by logging in to CloudForms and navigating to *Configuration -> Configuration Management -> Ansible Tower Job Templates -> All Ansible Tower Job Templates -> ansible1.example.com Configuration Manager*:
+
image::images/satscreenshot2.png[]

.. Save your changes.

. Navigate to `/SatDomain/Integration/Satellite/Methods/RegisterSatellite` and examine the contents.
. Also examine the contents of the `register_satellite` method in the same namespace/class.  Below outlines the code:

[NOTE]
Satellite Registration using the API can be done via Ansible, but you use Ruby for this example.

* Assuming the VM being built is Linux (which it is in this case), the code selects a host group by testing the VM operating system object's `.product_name` attribute:
+
[source,ruby]
----
...
prov = $evm.root['miq_provision']
template = prov.source
vm = prov.destination

if template.platform == "linux"
  #
  # Pick a host group based on the operating system being provisioned
  #
  if vm.operating_system.product_name == 'Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6 (64-bit)' || vm.operating_system.product_name == 'rhel_6x64'
    hostgroup = 'Generic_RHEL6_Servers'
  elsif vm.operating_system.product_name == 'Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (64-bit)' || vm.operating_system.product_name == 'rhel_7x64'
    hostgroup = 'Generic_RHEL7_Servers'
  else
    raise "Unrecognised Operating System Name"
  end
...
----

* The code creates the new host entry using the Satellite API, which requires the internal Satellite ID for each parameter rather than a name. It defines a generic `query_id` method, and calls it three times to retrieve the IDs for the location, organization, and host group:
+
[source,ruby]
----
def query_id (uri, field, content)

  url = URI.escape("#{@uri_base}/#{uri}?search=#{field}=\"#{content}\"")
  request = RestClient::Request.new(
    method: :get,
    url: url,
    headers: @headers,
    verify_ssl: OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE
  )

  id = nil
  rest_result = request.execute
  json_parse = JSON.parse(rest_result)

  subtotal = json_parse['subtotal'].to_i
  if subtotal == 1
    id = json_parse['results'][0]['id'].to_s
  elsif subtotal.zero?
    $evm.log(:error, "Query to #{url} failed, no result")
    id = -1
  elsif subtotal > 1
    $evm.log(:error, "Query to #{url} returned multiple results")
    id = -1
  else
    $evm.log(:error, "Query to #{url} failed, unknown condition")
    id = -1
  end
  id
end

...
$evm.log(:info, "Getting hostgroup id for '#{hostgroup}' from Satellite")
hostgroup_id = query_id("hostgroups", "name", hostgroup)
raise "Cannot determine hostgroup id for '#{hostgroup}'" if hostgroup_id == -1
$evm.log(:info, "hostgroup_id: #{hostgroup_id}")
----

* Finally, the code creates the host record. It specifies the `:build` parameter as `false`, because you do not want Satellite to provision the VM:
+
[source,ruby]
----
#
# Create the host record
#
hostinfo = {
    :name             => vm.name,
    :mac              => vm.mac_addresses[0],
    :hostgroup_id     => hostgroup_id,
    :location_id      => location_id,
    :organization_id  => organization_id,
    :build            => 'false'
    }
$evm.log(:info, "Creating host record in Satellite")

uri = "#{@uri_base}/hosts"
request = RestClient::Request.new(
    method: :post,
    url: uri,
    headers: @headers,
    verify_ssl: OpenSSL::SSL::VERIFY_NONE,
    payload: { host: hostinfo }.to_json
  )
rest_result = request.execute

* In Satellite *Hosts -> Content Hosts*, you eventually see a new content host entry, showing that all packages need to be updated (Ansible is doing this for you now):
+
image::images/satscreenshot11.png[]


=== Examine Playbook and Job Completion

. The Ansible Playbook you used to activate Satellite is pulled dynamically from link:https://github.com/redhat-gpe/cf_customization_public/blob/master/satellite_config/satellite_config.yml["satellite_config.yml^"]. Take a look at it while you wait for the Ansible job to complete the yum update.

. When the Ansible job is complete, the content host record shows that all of the packages are updated (this can take a while):
+
image::images/content_done.png[]

== Stretch Goal: Create Custom Job Template utilizing Ansible Extra Variables in CloudForms

[NOTE]
This is only to be completed if time allows.  Some steps are left out on purpose to challenge your current knowledge and understanding of the CloudForms/Tower integration.  Have fun with it!

=== Create a Project/Playbook in Tower

. Create an empty repository in your personal GitHub account

. Decide what you would like to Automate
.. Common examples are:
... Install an RPM package
... Create a file with content

. Create the Ansible playbook.
.. Be sure to require an extra variable in this playbook

. Create the Project in Ansible Tower and tie it to your GitHub repository which contains the Ansible Playbook.


=== Create Job Template in Tower

. Create a job template in Ansible Tower with the following requirements
.. Below the *LIMIT* text box, check the *Prompt on launch* box.
.. This should be tied to the project you just created in the step above.
.. In the *EXTRA VARIABLES* text box enter any of the required variables like so:
+
[source,text]
----
---
my_extra_variable:
----
.. Below the *EXTRA VARIABLES* text box, check the *Prompt on launch* box.

=== Refresh Provider in CloudForms

. In CloudForms, refresh the Ansible Tower provider so that you can see the new job template.

=== Insert Job Template into Provisioning Workflow
