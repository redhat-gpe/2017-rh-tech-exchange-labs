=== Copy Playbook Into Ansible Projects Manually

. From your terminal, ssh from the *workstation.example.com* machine to the *ansible1.example.com* host.
+
If the directory `/root/rhte-na` does not exist, download it using the following command:
+
----
# git clone https://github.com/redhat-gpe/rhte-na.git
----

. Copy the *ws_config.yml* playbook and *roles* directory from the `/root/rhte-na/hybrid_cloud_management/labs/lab2/source` directory into a new directory named *webserver_config* in `/var/lib/awx/projects`

.. Make the */var/lib/awx/projects/webserver_config* directory.
+
----
# mkdir /var/lib/awx/projects/webserver_config
----
+
[NOTE]
The directory `/var/lib/awx/projects` is where manual projects as well as source controlled project caches get stored.

.. Switch to the `/root/rhte-na/hybrid_cloud_management/labs/lab2/source` directory.
+
----
# cd /root/rhte-na/hybrid_cloud_management/labs/lab2/source
----

.. Copy the *ws_config.yml* playbook and *roles* directory to the *webserver_config* directory.
+
----
# cp ws_config.yml /var/lib/awx/projects/webserver_config
# cp -r roles /var/lib/awx/projects/webserver_config
----

.. Change ownership of the webserver_config folder to `awx`
+
----
# chown -R awx:awx /var/lib/awx/projects/webserver_config
----

. Navigate to the *Projects* tab.
. Click *+Add*.
. Fill in the *NAME* as *Webserver Configuration*.
. Click the search button for Organization and select *Default*.

+
image::images/project_new_project.png[]

. Navigate to *Credentials*
+
image::images/credentials_home.png[]

. Click *+ADD*.

. Fill in the *NAME* as *Lab Machines*. 
. For type select *Machine* as this is going to be the credential that tower uses to SSH to the target host.
. Fill out the *USERNAME* as `awxservice` which is a local user on the workstation machine.
+
[NOTE]
The *awxservice* user has the ability to `sudo` to *root* on the *workstation* host to run commands that require priviledge escalation.

. Set *PRIVILEGE ESCALATION* method to *sudo*. 
. Set *PRIVILEGE ESCALATION USERNAME* to *root*.
+

+
image::images/job_template_create.png[]

. Under `EXTRA VARIABLES` we want to select `Prompt on launch`. This will allow extra variables to be passed to the playbook at instantiation time.
+
image::images/job_template_save.png[]

.. Do not input any extra variables when prompted.
+
image::images/job_template_selection.png[]

.. Click *LAUNCH*.

. Observe that when the Job Template was run it is a new Job instance that is actually ran. You should see the ansible playbook log on the right side on the Job window.

=== Verify Job Run

. After the job run is complete, on the workstation host, run the following command:
+
----
# curl http://localhost
----

. You should see the following output:
+
----
Hello World, I was configured using Ansible!
----

=== Run Job With Extra Vars

. Run the Job Template again only this time passing in extra variables.

.. When prompted for extra variables, input the following YAML into the text box.
+
----
---
body_content: "Hello from the extra vars!"
----

=== Verify Job Run With Extra Vars

. After the job run is complete, on the workstation host, run the following command:

. You should see the following output:
+
----
Hello from the extra vars!

== Lab 2 Stretch Goal 1

. *Stretch Goal:* Configure LDAP Authentication
+
There is a Red Hat Directory Server (RHDS) LDAP server configured on the *ansible1.example.com* host with a couple users created.
+
One user is named *tower* with a password of *passw0rd* which you should use to configure as the BIND DN for Tower.
+
There is also a user named *consultant* with a password of *r3dh4t1!* which you should be able to log in with System Administrator access in Tower. This user belongs to the *Consultants* group in LDAP.

.. Log in to the Tower UI as admin.

.. Navigate to Settings -> Configure Tower

.. Navigate to the Sub Category *LDAP*
+
image::images/ldap_config.png[]

.. Set the LDAP SERVER URI to `ldap://ansible1.example.com:389`

.. Set the LDAP BIND DN to *uid=tower,ou=people,dc=example,dc=com*

.. Set the LDAP BIND PASSWORD to *passw0rd*

.. Set the LDAP GROUP TYPE to `GroupOfUniqueNames`

.. Set LDAP USER SEARCH to the following in order to set the search DN, the scope, and the attribute which should be mapped to the username to sign in with.
+
----
[
 "OU=People,DC=example,DC=com",
 "SCOPE_SUBTREE",
 "(uid=%(user)s)"
]
----

.. Set LDAP GROUP SEARCH to the following in order to set the search DN to find the groups.
+
----
[
 "OU=Groups,DC=example,DC=com",
 "SCOPE_SUBTREE",
 "(objectClass=group)"
]
----

.. Set the LDAP USER ATTRIBUTE MAP to the following in order to map the LDAP attributes to the appropriate Tower parameters.
+
----
{
 "first_name": "givenName",
 "last_name": "sn",
 "email": "mail"
}
----

.. Set the LDAP USER FLAGS BY GROUP to the following in order to map the *Consultants* group to be "Super Users" which will function as System Administrator for the Tower. The users that belong to this group will have the same privilege as *admin*.
+
----
{
"is_superuser": "cn=Consultants,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com"
}
----

. Log in to Tower first as the *tower* user with *passw0rd* as the password in order to see what Tower looks like without any privilege. This user is configured from LDAP. The password is configured in the LDAP server.

. Log in to Tower as the *consultant* user with *r3dh4t1!* as the password. If the mapping worked you should see everything you were able to see as the *admin* user.
