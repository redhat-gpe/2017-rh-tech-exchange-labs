=== Copy Playbook Into Ansible Projects Manually

. From your terminal, ssh from the *workstation.example.com* machine to the *ansible1.example.com* host.
+
If the directory `/root/rhte-na` does not exist, download it using the following command:
+
----
# git clone https://github.com/redhat-gpe/rhte-na.git
----

. Copy the *ws_config.yml* playbook and *roles* directory from the `/root/rhte-na/hybrid_cloud_management/labs/lab2/source` directory into a new directory named *webserver_config* in `/var/lib/awx/projects`

.. Make the */var/lib/awx/projects/webserver_config* directory.
+
----
# mkdir /var/lib/awx/projects/webserver_config
----
+
[NOTE]
The directory `/var/lib/awx/projects` is where manual projects as well as source controlled project caches get stored.

.. Switch to the `/root/rhte-na/hybrid_cloud_management/labs/lab2/source` directory.
+
----
# cd /root/rhte-na/hybrid_cloud_management/labs/lab2/source
----

.. Copy the *ws_config.yml* playbook and *roles* directory to the *webserver_config* directory.
+
----
# cp ws_config.yml /var/lib/awx/projects/webserver_config
# cp -r roles /var/lib/awx/projects/webserver_config
----

.. Change ownership of the webserver_config folder to `awx`
+
----
# chown -R awx:awx /var/lib/awx/projects/webserver_config

+
image::images/job_template_home_add.png[]

. Fill in *Lab Webserver Configuration* for the name. The Job Type should be `Run`.
+
image::images/job_template_create.png[]

. For Inventory, select the search icon and select the inventory we previously created, `Lab Hosts`
+
For the Project, select the search icon and select the Project we created, `Webserver Configuration`. For the Playbook you will want to select `ws_config.yml`.

. For the Machine Credential we will select the `Lab Machines` credential.
+
Because the playbook itself contains the configuration to escalate to root for it's tasks, we do not need to select `Enable Privilege Escalation`.

. Under `Extra Variables` we want to select `Prompt on launch`. This will allow extra variables to be passed to the playbook at instantiation time.
+
image::images/job_template_save.png[]

. Finally, select *Save* to create this Job Template.

=== Launch Job Template

In this section we will run the *Lab Webserver Configuration* Job Template.

. Navigate to the `Templates` tab.

. Locate the `Lab Webserver Configuration` Job Template and click the run button (this is the rocketship button).
.. Do not input any extra variables when prompted.
+
image::images/job_template_selection.png[]

. Observe that when the Job Template was run it is a new Job instance that is actually ran. You should see the ansible playbook log on the right side on the Job window.

. Run the Job Template again only this time passing in extra variables.

.. When prompted for extra variables, input the following YAML into the text box.
+

body_content: "Hello from the extra vars!"

== Lab 2 Stretch Goal 1

. *Stretch Goal:* Configure LDAP Authentication
+
There is a Red Hat Directory Server (RHDS) LDAP server configured on the *ansible1.example.com* host with a couple users created.
+
One user is named *tower* with a password of *passw0rd* which you should use to configure as the BIND DN for Tower.
+
There is also a user named *consultant* with a password of *r3dh4t1!* which you should be able to log in with System Administrator access in Tower. This user belongs to the *Consultants* group in LDAP.

.. Log in to the Tower UI as admin.

.. Navigate to Settings -> Configure Tower

.. Navigate to the Sub Category *LDAP*
+
image::images/ldap_config.png[]

.. Set the LDAP SERVER URI to `ldap://ansible1.example.com:389`

.. Set the LDAP BIND DN to *tower*

.. Set the LDAP BIND PASSWORD to *passw0rd*

.. Set the LDAP GROUP TYPE to `GroupOfUniqueNames`

.. Set LDAP USER SEARCH to the following in order to set the search DN, the scope, and the attribute which should be mapped to the username to sign in with.
+
----
[
 "OU=People,DC=example,DC=com",
 "SCOPE_SUBTREE",
 "(uid=%(user)s)"
]
----

.. Set LDAP GROUP SEARCH to the following in order to set the search DN to find the groups.
+
----
[
 "OU=Groups,DC=example,DC=com",
 "SCOPE_SUBTREE",
 "(objectClass=group)"
]
----

.. Set the LDAP USER ATTRIBUTE MAP to the following in order to map the LDAP attributes to the appropriate Tower parameters.
+
----
{
 "first_name": "givenName",
 "last_name": "sn",
 "email": "mail"
}
----

.. Set the LDAP USER FLAGS BY GROUP to the following in order to map the *Consultants* group to be "Super Users" which will function as System Administrator for the Tower. The users that belong to this group will have the same privilege as *admin*.
+
----
{
"is_superuser": "cn=Consultants,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=com"
}
----

. Log in to Tower first as the *tower* user with *passw0rd* as the password in order to see what Tower looks like without any privilege. This user is configured from LDAP. The password is configured in the LDAP server.

. Log in to Tower as the *consultant* user with *r3dh4t1!* as the password. If the mapping worked you should see everything you were able to see as the *admin* user.
